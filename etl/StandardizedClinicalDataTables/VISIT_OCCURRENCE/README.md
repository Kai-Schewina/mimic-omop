# Source Tables (mimic)

##Â [admissions](https://mimic.physionet.org/mimictables/admissions/)

- some informations from admissions are populated elsewhere (religion, ethnicity, deathtime) respectiveley in (observation, person/observation, death)
- emergency information have been extracted
- when the admissions is emergency, then 
	- the admission start datetime becomes the emergency start datetime
	- that emergency stay is added to transfers (in the `visit_detail` table)
- `visit_type_concept_id` is always equals to 44818518 (visit derived from EHR)
- `visit_concept_id` is either equals to 9201 (inpatient visit) or 262 (emergency room and inpatient visit) when admitting by emergency
- in mimic when patient is organ donor, patient died twice. In omop format
        - a new admission category is created as Patient died (concept_id = 4216643)
        - a new discharge category is created as Organ donor (concept_id = 4022058)

# Mapping used

## [visit_source_concept_id](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-omop/blob/master/extras/google/concept/admission_type_to_concept.csv)

- it maps mimic admission type to omop admission type

## [admitting_source_concept_id](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-omop/blob/master/extras/google/concept/admission_location_to_concept.csv)

- it maps mimic location admission type to omop location admission type

## [discharge_type_to_concept](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-omop/blob/master/extras/google/concept/discharge_location_to_concept.csv)

- it maps mimic location discharge type to omop location discharge type

# Examples

## Number of admissions

``` sql
SELECT COUNT(distinct visit_occurrence_id) AS num_admission_count
FROM visit_occurrence;
```
| num_admission_count |
|---------------------|
|               58976|

## Number of dead patients in hospital

``` sql
SELECT count(distinct visit_occurrence_id) AS dead_hospital_count
FROM visit_occurrence
WHERE discharge_to_concept_id = 4216643;                          -- concept.concept_name = 'Patient died'
```
| dead_hospital_count |
|---------------------|
|                5854|

## % of dead patients in hospital 

``` sql
WITH tmp AS
(
  SELECT COUNT(distinct d.visit_occurrence_id) AS dead
       , COUNT(distinct t.visit_occurrence_id) AS total
  FROM visit_occurrence t
  LEFT JOIN
  (
        SELECT visit_occurrence_id
        FROM visit_occurrence
        WHERE discharge_to_concept_id = 4216643                   -- concept.concept_name = 'Patient died'
  
  ) d USING (visit_occurrence_id)

)
SELECT dead, total, dead * 100 / total as percentage FROM tmp;
```
| dead | total | percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| 5854 | 58976 |          9|
