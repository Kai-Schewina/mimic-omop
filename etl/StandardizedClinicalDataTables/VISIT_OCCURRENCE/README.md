# Source Tables

##Â [admissions](https://mimic.physionet.org/mimictables/admissions/)

- some informations from admissions are populated elsewhere (religion, ethnicity, deathtime) respectiveley in (observation, person/observation, death)
- emergency information have been extracted
- when the admissions is emergency, then 
	- the admission start datetime becomes the emergency start datetime
	- that emergency stay is added to transfers (in the `visit_detail` table)
- `visit_type_concept_id` is always equals to 44818518 (visit derived from EHR)
- `visit_concept_id` is either equals to 9201 (inpatient visit) or 262 (emergency room and inpatient visit) when admitting by emergency

# Examples

## Number of patients in the visit_occurrence
``` sql
SELECT COUNT(distinct person_id) AS num_admission_count
FROM visit_occurrence;
```

## Number of dead patients in hospital
``` sql
SELECT count(person_id) AS dead_hospital_count
FROM visit_occurrence
WHERE discharge_to_concept_id = 4216643;                          -- concept.concept_name = 'Patient died'
```

## % of dead patients in hospital 
``` sql
WITH tmp AS
(
  SELECT COUNT(distinct d.person_id) AS dead
       , COUNT(t.person_id) AS total
  FROM visit_occurrence t
  LEFT JOIN
  (
        SELECT person_id
        FROM visit_occurrence
        WHERE discharge_to_concept_id = 4216643                   -- concept.concept_name = 'Dead'
  ) d USING (person_id)
)
SELECT dead, total, dead * 100 / total as percentage FROM tmp;
```
